# Introduction to Algorithms and Apriori Analysis Discussion 


## Algorithms

- Algorithm are the step by step (or) "sequence of finite steps", procedure, instructions, processes "to perform some specific task".

- Suppose for example let's take example of multiplication of two numbers "a" & "b":
```
1. Take two numbers --> a & b.
2. Take c = a * b
3. Return c.  
```

- Algorithm has "certain properties/features" to differentiate it from normal code. Every code is not an Algorithm.


### Properties :
<hr>

1. Terminate after finite amount of time.
2. Produce atleast one output.
3. Independent of any programming.
